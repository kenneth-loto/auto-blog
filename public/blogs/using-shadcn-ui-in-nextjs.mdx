Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications, and Shadcn provides a set of beautiful, accessible, and reusable components to make your development workflow faster and cleaner. In this post, we'll go through how to integrate shadcn UI into a Next.js project and start using it in your pages.

## What is shadcn?

[Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) is a component library built on top of Tailwind CSS. It focuses on modular, customizable, and accessible components for React applications. Key features include:

- Lightweight and fast  
- Fully TypeScript-ready  
- Seamless integration with modern frameworks like Next.js  
- Pre-styled, accessible UI components for faster development  

Essentially, shadcn UI saves you time by giving you ready-made components that you can customize to match your design system.

## Example: Using a Button Component

You can directly import React components in MDX. Here's an example using the `Button` from shadcn UI:

<Button variant="default" onClick={() => alert("Hello from shadcn UI!")}>
  Click Me
</Button>

You can customize the button using Tailwind classes or variants.

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

If you don’t have a Next.js project yet, you can create one easily with the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
